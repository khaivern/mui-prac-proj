            <Typography variant='body1' paragraph>
              In 2013, Facebook invented a new way of building websites. This new system, React.js,
              completely revolutionizes the process and practice of website development.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant='body1' paragraph>
              Instead of chaining together long individual pages, like traditional websites, React
              websites are built with little chunks of code called components. These components are
              faster, easier to maintain, and are easily reused and customized, each serving a
              singular purpose.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant='body1' paragraph>
              Two years later they shocked the world by releasing a similar system, React Native,
              for producing iOS and Android apps. Instead of having to master two completely
              separate development platforms, you can leverage the knowledge you already possessed
              from building websites and reapply it directly! This was a{" "}
              <strong>
                <em>huge</em>
              </strong>{" "}
              leap forward.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant='body1' paragraph>
              This technology is now being used by companies like AirBnB, Microsoft, Netflix,
              Pinterest, Skype, Tesla, UberEats, and when Facebook purchased Instagram large
              portions of it were even rebuilt using React.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant='body1' paragraph>
              Developers have since built on top of these systems by automating project setup and
              deployment, allowing creators to focus as much as possible on their work itself.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant='body1' paragraph>
              These technical advancements translate into savings by significantly reducing the
              workload and streamlining the workflow for developing new pieces of software, while
              also lowering the barrier to entry for mobile app development.
